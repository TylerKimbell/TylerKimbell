Hi, I'm Tyler Kimbell! 
  I am looking for a starting position or an internship in the software engineering field. I'm really interested in creating things that are useful for others. My current project 
is a highly customizable to do list that I lovingly named the Human Task Manager. I'm building it with the intent to keep my own life more on track, but I hope others will find it 
useful as well. My main goal is to make something that is very useful, while also being simple and minimal. I update it daily and have been implementing new features at a fairly 
steady pace. My hope is to one day port it to mobile and set up a syncing service so that the desktop application will sync with the mobile app. It is private on my github under the name HumanTaskManager. If a recruiter wants a demonstration of the program I will be happy to show it off during an interview. 

  I'd love to get a job making, or working on, programs that other people or businesses need to better their lives or business. Because I don't have any work experience in the 
software engineering field, I am more than willing to take on internships to build the necessary skills and experience I would need for my desired position. If you like what I'm 
doing or are have an opportunity that you think I would be a good fit for you can contact me at tyler.kimbell@live.com 

Thank you for reading this! I hope you have a good day.
